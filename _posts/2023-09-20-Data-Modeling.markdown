- When working on this assignment, I was very satisfied with the way that the data is repersented in the ER diagram and schema. 

- I had some complications when working on the ER diagram and schema. When it came to finding the different types of entities and what their attributes in the Schema. I also had a hard time with the relationship between the entities in the ER Diagram.
