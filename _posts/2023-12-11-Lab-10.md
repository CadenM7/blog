-With Lab 10, the first part of the tutorial was easy. But due to it being better for only one person to do the Azure Pages, I would take on the job of getting it up and running. The biggest problem that I ran into was with the creation of the Azure Page was that everything Updated to Net 8 which through all the code and everything with it out of wack. But the project was completed and the page was up and running with everyone being able to access it.
